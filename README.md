# E-Commerce-App
The E-Commerce App provides a complete shopping journey starting from product browsing to order checkout.   It uses **Firebase Authentication** for user management and **Firebase Firestore** as the backend to store products, cart data, addresses, and orders.  The project follows a scalable approach suitable for real-world Flutter applications.
